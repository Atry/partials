## Background

In this article, we will use [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) classifier to build a simple image classification neural network with an accuracy of 32%. In a Softmax classifier, binary logic is generalized and regressed to multiple logic. Softmax classifier will output the probability of the corresponding category.

We will first define a softmax classifier, then use the training set of [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) to train the neural network, and finally use the test set to verify the accuracy of the neural network.

Let’s get started.
