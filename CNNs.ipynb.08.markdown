This is a neural network performing Relu calculation after convolution calculation, here we set `kernelSize` to 3*3, and both `Padding` and `Stride` are 1 at two directions. The reason for this setting is to keep the original dimensions of the picture when its enters the convolution layer, so as to keep picture dimensions unchanged during overlaying of many networks. Otherwise, the dimensions of the picture may reduce quickly, and most data may be lost, resulting in the reduce of parameters learned by the neural network, which will undermine the prediction effect.
