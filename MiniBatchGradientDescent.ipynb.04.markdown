Like the previous article, we need to train the neural network. However, the difference is that the training data in this article are read randomly, and in the last article one batch of data set is used for its repeated training. Train the neural network and observe the change of `loss` in each training. The trend of `loss` is decrease, however, we need to find out whether it decreases every time. (The future is bright, the road is tortuous.)
