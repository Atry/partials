This article is different with the previous article, in this article, we will adopt some means for parameter tuning, set learning rate and use [L2Regularization](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html),L2Regularization can be used to avoid [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting). We also solved the problem of too-slow decrease or no decrease of `loss` due to relatively high `learningRate` during extended training time, by decreasing each iteration `learningRate` to that 0.9995 time of each of its original value.
